### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:telescope: Iâ€™m currently a part of the Cloud App Platform Team at [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). I was a GSoC student developer for [Thanos](https://thanos.io) during summer 2020 and then I joined the team as a maintainer. I have prevoiusly spoken at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon (EU 2021) and a talk at [DevoxxUK](https://www.devoxx.co.uk/) later that year. :seedling: Iâ€™m currently learning how to build distributed and reliable systems. Interested in all things related to Go, Linux, Site Reliability, React, TypeScript, and Observability.

You can find me on Twitter [@onprem_](https://twitter.com/onprem_), on [poly.work/onprem](https://poly.work/onprem) and on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/onprem).
